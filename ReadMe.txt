Explanation:
	Create MyString class:
		Build Class MyString: clone original char array to myChars
		Create printMyString method: print myChars as a string
		Build a Junit test for printMyString method by testPrintMyString1 and testPrintMyString2
	
	Create length() method: 
		count the number of characters in myChars
		Build a Junit test for length method by testLength
	
	Create charAt() method: 
		Find character is the index of  myChars
		Build a Junit test for charAt method by testCharAt
	
	Create substring() method: 
		get characters from beginIndex to endIndex in myChars, and copy characters to new myChars. Build new myString with new myChars.
		Build a Junit test for substring method by testSubstring1 and testSubstring2
		
	Create toLowerCase() method: 
		Create a loop for each character and replace it with result of Character.toLowerCase() 
		
	Create equals() method: 
		Check if length is correct, if yes then create a loop to compare each symbol + calculate count of compared symbols, break the loop if symbols are not the same. 
		If number of compared symbols is the same as length - return true, if not - return false. 
	
	Create valueOf() method: 
		Create a list of chars with the int length, then run the loop. In this loop, divide the number by 10 and get 1 digit.
